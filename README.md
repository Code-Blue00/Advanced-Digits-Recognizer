# Advanced-Digits-Recognizer
1. INTRODUCTION

The project features an ensemble of different neural network architectures which are designed for handwrittten digits recognition. By combining different architectures which include - Residual Neural Networks(ResNet), Dense Neural Networks(DenseNet), Vision Transformer(ViT) and Hybrid Vision Transformer(Hybrid ViT)

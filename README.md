# Advanced-Digits-Recognizer
1. INTRODUCTION 
>The project features an ensemble of different neural network architectures which are designed for handwrittten digits recognition. By combining different architectures which includes - Residual Neural Network(ResNet), Dense Neural Network(DenseNet), Vision Transformer(ViT) and Hybrid Vision Transformer(Hybrid ViT). The ensemble of models on top of data augmentation yields an accuracy of 99.62% on Kaggles Public Score for the test data.
